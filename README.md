###ðŸŽ§ Urban Sound Classification using Deep Learning

This project classifies urban sound clips from the UrbanSound8K dataset using a deep learning model. It processes audio files and predicts the type of sound, such as sirens, dog barks, or street music. A Flask-based web interface allows users to upload audio files and receive predictions in real-time. The model has been trained on spectrogram features extracted from audio clips, ensuring accurate classification.
